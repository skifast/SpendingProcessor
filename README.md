# SpendingProcessor
'''The goal of this project is to organize recorded transactions into categories. It will ultimately produce a 
document for the user to analyze their credit or debit expenditures. Right now, the program writes files with 
the website titles corresponding to each transaction. These can eventually be used in a database for machine learning 
to categorize a given transaction into categories.  '''
